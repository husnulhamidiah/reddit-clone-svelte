# Reddit Clone Svelte

This project is a front-end only reddit clone that I wrote to learn abaout Svelte. The philosophy of this project is heavily inspired from [Asperitas](https://github.com/d11z/asperitas/tree/master/client).

## Prerequisites

1. Node
2. Reddit Clone API

    You can have your own API as long as it follows the [Blueprint]() in this repository. Or If you in a hurry, you can pick one from this list:

    | Language      | Name          | Source         | Status | Mantainer |
    | ------------- | ------------- | :------------- | :----- | :--- |
    | Javascript    | reddit-clone-api-js | [github]() | complete | [husnulhamidiah](https://github.com/husnulhamidiah) |
    | Ruby          | reddit-clone-api-rb | | development | |
    | Golang        | reddit-clone-api-go | | TBA | |

## Installation

1. Clone the respository
2. Install dependencies
    ```bash
    cd reddit-clone-svelte
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the app
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.
